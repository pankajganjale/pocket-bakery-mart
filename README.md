# Pocket-Bakery-Mart(MERN Stack)

Pocket-Bakery-Mart is an online Bakery Store where consumers can go and purchase the items and make the payment for the same.

In this project we have tried to make the exact same site which we have got from our designer team. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality. This Project is build as part of Masai School (30 weeks Bootcamp) Curriculum project and completed in duration of 5 days.

To run this project, you will need to run:

```
server: npm run server
client: npm start
```
